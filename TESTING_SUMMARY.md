# Testing Summary

## ✅ Completed Actions

1. **Code Pushed to GitHub**: https://github.com/shuffleo/p2p-gyro-game
   - All files committed and pushed
   - Repository is ready for collaboration

2. **Dependencies Installed**:
   - PeerJS (for WebRTC)
   - Three.js (for 3D visualization)
   - Vite (build tool)
   - Tailwind CSS (styling)
   - PostCSS & Autoprefixer

3. **Dev Server Started**: `npm run dev`
   - Server should be running on http://localhost:3000
   - Hot module replacement enabled

## 🧪 Quick Test Guide

### 1. Open the Application
```
Open Chrome browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Test Landing Screen
- **Generate Code**: Click "Generate Code" button
  - ✅ Should generate 8-24 character alphanumeric code
  - ✅ Code should appear in input field
  - ✅ Code should be saved to localStorage

- **Custom Code**: Type a custom code (e.g., "ABC123XYZ")
  - ✅ Should accept valid codes (8-24 alphanumeric)
  - ✅ Should reject invalid codes (< 8, > 24, or special characters)

- **Join Room**: Click "Join Room" with valid code
  - ✅ Desktop: Should show waiting room screen
  - ✅ Mobile: Should show mobile game screen

### 3. Test Waiting Room (Desktop)
- ✅ Room code should be displayed
- ✅ "Copy" button should copy code to clipboard
- ✅ Connection status should show "Connecting..."
- ✅ Device list should show current device
- ✅ "Exit Room" should return to landing screen

### 4. Test Mobile Game Screen
- Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
- Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M / Cmd+Shift+M)
- Select mobile device (e.g., iPhone 12)
- Join a room
- ✅ Should show mobile game screen
- ✅ Permission request section should be visible
- ✅ Room code should be displayed

### 5. Test Room Constraints
Open multiple browser tabs/windows:

**Test Max 3 Devices**:
1. Tab 1: Join room "TEST1234"
2. Tab 2: Join room "TEST1234"
3. Tab 3: Join room "TEST1234"
4. Tab 4: Try to join room "TEST1234"
   - ✅ Should show error: "Room is full. Maximum 3 devices allowed."
   - ✅ Error should have copy-to-clipboard functionality

**Test Max 1 Mobile Device**:
1. Tab 1 (Mobile emulation): Join room "TEST5678"
2. Tab 2 (Mobile emulation): Try to join room "TEST5678"
   - ✅ Should show error: "Room already has a mobile device. Maximum 1 mobile device allowed."

### 6. Test localStorage Persistence
1. Generate/join a room
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. ✅ Room code should still be in the input field

## 📋 Expected Results

### ✅ Working Features
- Room code generation (8-24 alphanumeric)
- Room code validation
- Screen navigation (landing → waiting room / mobile game)
- Device detection (mobile vs desktop)
- Room constraint enforcement (max 3 devices, max 1 mobile)
- localStorage persistence
- Error handling with copy-to-clipboard
- Responsive UI (mobile and desktop)
- Connection status indicators
- Automatic peer discovery
- Connection quality monitoring
- WebRTC peer connections
- Real-time device list updates
- Gyroscope data collection
- 3D visualization

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Dev Server Not Running
```bash
cd /Users/shuffleo/Github/p2p-gyro-game
npm run dev
```

### Port Already in Use
If port 3000 is busy, Vite will automatically use the next available port.
Check the terminal output for the actual URL.

### Console Errors
- Check browser console (F12) for any JavaScript errors
- All modules should load without errors
- No network errors expected for Phase 1 & 2

### localStorage Issues
- Some browsers block localStorage in private/incognito mode
- Use regular browsing mode for testing
